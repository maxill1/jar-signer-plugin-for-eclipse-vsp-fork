This eclipse plugin is a fork of Hugo Guerrero's "net.sf.vsp.signer". All credits goes to him.

http://sourceforge.net/projects/jarsigner.

It needs a jardesc file in order to show the "Create Signed JAR" context menu item.

It uses oracle jarsigner to sign a jar, so it needs java JDK.

This plugin should work with Eclipse Indigo and greater (tested with Juno and jdk 1.6.0\_23 and 1.6.0\_45) and should fix these issues:
